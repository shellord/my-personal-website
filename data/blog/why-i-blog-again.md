Well saying “again” will be an over statement cause before my blog was an utter trash to be honest 💩.
I was a kid when I first started writing blogs and most of them were childish things that I would cringe reading it now 😬.

## Whats the difference now ?

Now i’m planning to write about my **programming journey** and also maybe shit posting **about things that I think about life and my views about certain things.**

It will be mostly my **development journal** and maybe some of my **thoughts about life**. I will try to make it bit more structured and maybe even more organized.
